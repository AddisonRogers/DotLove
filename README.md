# DotLove
A Valentine's project / gift for my girlfriend Jodie.

Really basic idea is for the website to be supported / encouraged as a progressive web app. 

An app to be the companion for your companionship. Shared Calender, Date/Anniversary alerts, Date ideas and More!

The app will be coded using Svelte + SvelteKit Because of it's ease of use and performance. Hosted on Cloudflare.

Release date (hopefully) : Feburary 2023
